## Assets Used

- **Sprites:**
  - Player characters (red, blue, gray, yellow)
  - Monsters
  - Weapons (sword, arrow)
  - Effects (explosions)
  - Map tiles
- **Location:** All assets are in the `public/` folder, organized by type.

## Asset Format

- **Image Format:** PNG
- **Sprite Sheets:** Used for characters, monsters, weapons, and effects
- **Map Images:** PNG format, compatible with Excalibur.js

## Adding/Modifying Assets

- Place new PNGs in the appropriate `public/` subfolder (e.g., `sprites/`, `maps/`, `hud/`).
- Sprite sheets should match the grid and size expected by the code (see `character-animations.ts` for details).
- Example for adding a new character sprite:

```ts
const newSheet = ex.SpriteSheet.fromImageSource({
  image: Images.newCharacterSheetImage,
  grid: { columns: 10, rows: 10, spriteWidth: 32, spriteHeight: 32 },
});
```

## Compatibility

- **Browser:** Modern browsers with ES6+ and WebGL support
- **Image Format:** PNG (with transparency recommended)
- **Sprite Sheet Grid:** Must match the code's expectations for columns, rows, and sprite size
