# 05. Multiplayer and Networking

## Multiplayer Overview

- **Library:** [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/) for peer-to-peer networking
- **How it works:**
  - Each player is assigned a unique peer ID
  - Game state (player and monster updates) is synchronized between peers
  - New players connect and receive the current state

## How to Play Multiplayer

- Start the game in multiple browser windows or devices
- Each instance will connect to the PeerJS server and discover other peers
- Actions and positions are broadcast to all connected peers

## Example: Sending a State Update

```ts
peer.sendUpdate(player.createNetworkUpdateString());
```

## Notes

- Multiplayer is real-time but may be affected by network latency
- Only modern browsers are supported
