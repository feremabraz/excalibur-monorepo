# 06. Extending and Customizing

## How to Extend the Game

- **Add new actors:** Create new classes in `src/actors/` and add them to the game in `main.ts` or via events.
- **Add new maps:** Place new map images in `public/maps/` and create new map classes in `src/maps/`.
- **Add new actions:** Extend `PlayerActions.ts` or add new input handlers in `Player.ts`.
- **Add new assets:** Place new PNGs in the appropriate `public/` subfolder and update `resources.ts` to load them.

## Example: Adding a New Weapon

```ts
// 1. Add your weapon sprite to public/sprites/
// 2. Import and load it in src/resources.ts
import { Images } from "../resources.js";
const myWeaponSheet = ex.SpriteSheet.fromImageSource({
  image: Images.myWeaponSheetImage,
  grid: { columns: 4, rows: 1, spriteWidth: 32, spriteHeight: 32 },
});
// 3. Create a new Actor class in src/actors/
```

## Modding Tips

- Use Excalibur's [documentation](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/) for advanced features
- Use TypeScript's type system to catch errors early
- Organize new features in their own files/folders for clarity

## Troubleshooting

- **Game not starting?** Check the browser console for errors
- **Assets not loading?** Make sure the file paths and names match exactly
- **Multiplayer not working?** Ensure you have internet access and PeerJS is reachable
