# 03. Rendering and Engine

## Rendering

- **Engine:** [Excalibur.js](https://excaliburjs.com/)
- **Rendering Mode:** Canvas/WebGL (handled by Excalibur)
- **Game Loop:** Fixed update FPS (60 by default)
- **Camera:** Follows the player, limited to map bounds

## How Rendering Works

- Sprites and animations are loaded from PNG sprite sheets
- Actors (players, monsters, weapons) are rendered as Excalibur `Actor` objects
- The map is rendered as a background image with collision boundaries

## Example: Adding a New Actor

```ts
import { Actor, Vector } from "excalibur";
const myActor = new Actor({
  pos: new Vector(100, 100),
  width: 32,
  height: 32,
});
game.add(myActor);
```

## Engine Configuration

- See `main.ts` for engine setup and configuration
- Custom camera strategies and scene management are supported
